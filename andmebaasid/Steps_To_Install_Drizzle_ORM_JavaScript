Steps to get Drizzle ORM installed on empty JavaScript project and generate football club database:

1. Create new folder for project
2. Open command line inside the folder
3. Create package manager meta file using 'npm init' command. Or you can also skip all those options using 'npm init -y'
4. Open Drizzle documentation website
5. Follow commands in 'Get started' section based what database you use, eg PostgreSQL
5.1. Install packages needed
5.2. Create new file for migration script
5.3. Copy code example from documentation (there is something missing from example, we'll find the missing part later)
5.4. Change the connection parameters like username, password and database name (you have to also create the actual database in pgAdmin)
6. Let's read about how to create schema. See 'Manage schema' section in Drizzle documentation.
6.1. It's a small project so one file for schema should be enough. Check that you copy the right database example.
6.2. Rename tables and fields of the example based on football club database. Make only tables: players, teams, guardians, playerGuardians
7. Let's create command line tools to generate migrations based on schema file. Open Drizzle Kit manual. In step 5.2 you created migration script, let's update this file now. There are example of how to add migrationsFolder option to existing code. Remove await keyword...
7.1. Create drizzle.config file
7.2. Update schema folder, output folder, driver and dbCredentials values in config. There are more examples how to write this config in "Quick start" section of Drizzle Kit doc.
7.3. Add drizzle kit commands to package.json script object
"generate": "drizzle-kit generate:pg",
"migrate": "drizzle-kit push:pg",
7.4. Run generate command and then migrate command
8. Check if tables where created in database
9. If you are able, add foreign key constraints for
"players - teams" and "players - playerGuardians - guardians"
9.1. Generate new migration after changes
